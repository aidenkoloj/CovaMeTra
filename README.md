# CovaMeTra
## Covariance of Metabolomics and Transciptomics

The objective of CovaMeTra is to correlate transciptomics with metabolomics. The motivation for this project is to provide another tool to uncover genes and metabolites involved in biological networks. This project uses data from 4 strains of *C. elegans*. Each strain has 6 biological replicates. RNA sequencing and metabolomics were performed on each replicate. Metabolomic data consists of the worm pellet and worm supernatant in both postiive and negative mode. The metabolomic data in this project is solely the negative supernatant data.
